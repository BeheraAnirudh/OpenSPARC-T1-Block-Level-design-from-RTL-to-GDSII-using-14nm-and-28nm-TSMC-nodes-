OpenSPARC T1 Physical Design â€“ RTL to GDSII
Technology Nodes: 14nm & 28nm (TSMC)
EDA Tools: Synopsys Design Compiler (DC), IC Compiler II (ICC2)

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements the block-level physical design flow for the OpenSPARC T1 processor core, starting from RTL and delivering a clean GDSII ready for fabrication. The design targeted optimal PPA (Power, Performance, Area) while ensuring sign-off compliance for manufacturability.

ðŸ”§ Methodology
Logic Synthesis

RTL synthesis with Design Compiler targeting 14nm & 28nm TSMC libraries.

Generated an optimized netlist for physical implementation.

Floorplanning & Power Delivery

Achieved 75% core utilization.

Performed density sweeps to evaluate congestion and routability.

Defined power grid with robust IR-drop margins.

Placement & Optimization

Timing-driven standard-cell placement.

Cell sizing, buffer insertion, and re-driving to fix DRVs (capacitance & transition).

Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)

Balanced skew and latency while minimizing power impact.

Routing & Post-Route Optimization

Performed global & detailed routing with detour minimization.

Multi-corner, multi-mode (MCMM) optimization for setup/hold closure.

Sign-off Verification

DRC, LVS, and antenna checks passed.

Final GDSII validated for tape-out readiness.

ðŸ“Š Key Results
Utilization: 75% core area

Node Coverage: 14nm & 28nm

Violations: 0 DRC, 0 LVS, 0 antenna issues

PPA: Achieved timing closure across multiple corners with balanced trade-offs
